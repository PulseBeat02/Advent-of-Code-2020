# Advent of Code 2020

---

### What is the Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual coding contest where users are given a large input and required
to perform multiple operations in order to get a desired result. These operations usually
require code in order to find the correct answer. More information can be found
[here](https://adventofcode.com/).

### About the Project
This project is trying to aim for something which avoids the use of streams/lambdas/etc to make the logic
clear for users to look at. The parent folder has multiple text files containing the input of
certain problems.
